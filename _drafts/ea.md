title: "The Realpolitik of Effective Altruism"
---

Effective Altruism is the most powerful new ideology of the 20th century.

Criticism of EA tends to get distracted with the details around its core philosophy.

In this essay I argue that EA is effective not because of its ideology but because its ability to:
1. Align competent people,
2. Deploy capital.

## Aligning competent people

More powerful than EA's ideas, is the audience of these ideas.
EA has been able to capture the imagination of the most ambitious young people in the world.
The fact that some of these people have high individual potential is a given.
EA provides a platform for them to align on a common goal, which enables the potential to sum [superlinearly](http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html) [^1].

Understanding EA in terms of writings on LessWrong is like trying to understand communism from the point of view of Marx's writings.
They are futile, if the question we're trying to answer is what effect did they have on the world.
Just think, how useful is _Das Kapital_ for understanding the CCP?

Marx did not write a manual for overthrowing governments.
He just outlined sufficiently compelling goals for young people to do just that.
Surprisingly, such goals together with the appropriate political climate, were sufficient for Bolsheviks to leverage asymmetric power [^2].

## Deploying capital

The core power of ideologies come from their ability to attract and deploy capital.
As much as talent is important.
Capital is critical.
For example, universities have a lot of talented students.
Yet, these students have little say in how the university endowments are spent.
Instead there's a wast bureaucracy that determines how universities spend their money.
This makes universities stable.
But it also means that universities tend to be cradles for innovative organisations rather than the innovative organisations themselves.

In the late 1980s a group of Afghan rebels formed an effective resistance the Soviet army.
Yet, this group would've gained little international notoriety (outside of Soviet veterans, perhaps), if not for capital.
It was the capital of Bin Laden family that transformed Mujahideen from a local rebel group, to the most well know terrorist group of all time -- al-Qaeda.

Earlier, I mentioned how providing a shared platform for ambitious individuals was the second main contribution of EA.
For al-Qaeda, this was a sufficiently important goal that it was literally named -- the Base.
In their case it was the base for aligning the various local rebel groups in the region.

## Evidence for the EA's effectiveness

**E/Acc is attacking the wrong thing about EA.**

EA has theory and practice.
Attacking theory for being insufficiently practical is an easy task.
Instead, if one takes a look at what EA has accomplished in practice, it has been amongst the most successful movements for accelerationism that we've seen in the past.

## Footnotes

[^1]: This is because throwing a coup, starting a corporation, or building a fusion reactor all follow threshold returns.
    They don't matter at all until a point where they matter a lot.

[^2]: Even by the standards of Russian revolutionaries of early 20th century Bolsheviks were the underdogs.
    Although the "Bolshevik" comes from Russian "Bolshe" meaning "larger", they were originally called such sarcastically.
    The "Mensheviks" ("Menshe" -> "fewer"), were the larger of the two parties that came out of the Social Democrat split.
