For most readers Orwell's ideas are limited to those expressed in __Animal Farm_ and _1984_. This is not because of their merit but their amenability in support of views expressed by orators and educators. Paradoxically the views supported by Orwell's most popular work would oppose Orwell's own beliefs as expressed in his larger body of work.
