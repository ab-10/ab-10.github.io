How does David Graeber assume progress works (implicitly or explicitly)?
1. Where has David Graeber equated that a better solution is conceivable with the fact that it is possible to achieve it?

How I believe it works?


What points am I trying to communicate:
1. The difference between how I see societal progress and how David Graeber sees it.
   Just saying that a better state of affairs is conceivable, it is not enough, we also need a path from the current state of affairs to the better one.
   Where has David Graber said that 
2. I don't think a military job is bullshit one.
   Although we can imagine a (better) world where no state has a military force, conceiving of a path to such a world would warrant a Nobel Peace Prize.
   Here we are locked in a Nash equilibruim, where if each individual state decides give up it's military force it would give up it's sovereignity as well.
3. Duct-tapers frequently don't perform a bullshit job, as the cost of a proper fix would not be economically justified.

# confession

I must confess that when I (mis)read _Debt: The First 5,000 Years_, I saw it as the anthropological justification for capitalism.
The book argues that debt forms the foundation of all human relationships and currency is merely means to measure debt.

In my opinion, if we accept the importance of debt in our society, the importance of currency follows immediately.
Even more, given that the principal holders of debt are banks, their highly esteemed role in our society is perfectly justified according to the aforementioned anthropological model.

```
“every day we wake up and collectively make a world together;
but which one of us, left to our own devices, would ever decide they wanted to make a world like this one?” [..]
In many respects, the science-fiction fantasies of the early twentieth century have become possible.
We can’t teleport or place colonies on Mars, it’s true, but we could easily rearrange matters in such a way that pretty much everyone on earth lived lives of relative ease and comfort.

Let's take a look at the world now:

We've had some ups and downs in the past but overall the current state of affairs is the best one we've ever had.

That being said, there are sources of pointless suffering in the world.
Numerous countries around the world are in military deadlock where the citizens are ultimately held hostage.
Beaurocratic processes that are in place to solve malnourishment and famine frequently feed themselves instead.
A careful examination of any commercial operation reveals duct tape solutions, maintanence of which wastes human potential and corporate budgets alike.
As one examines such suffering, it is only right to call _bullshit_ and fight against it.

However, where my disagreement with Graeber lies, is within the nature of the fight.
I think it's neither fair nor helpful to say that any job that occurs because of 

Why I believe there are more optimal systems out there:

```
Humans committed themselves to a unique trajectory when we invented socioeconomic status.
In terms of its caustic, scarring impact on minds and bodies, nothing in the history of animals being crappy to one another about status differences comes within light-years of our invention of poverty.

The Economist's criticism of Bullshit jobs: https://www.economist.com/business/2021/06/05/why-the-bullshit-jobs-thesis-may-be-well-bullshit
Economist slices a distinction between making a reasonable contribution to the society and the job being useless.
They also take a look at the relationship between education and fulfilment in the job.

What has been Graeber's response to it in the book?
