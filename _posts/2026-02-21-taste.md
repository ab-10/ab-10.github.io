Promise to the reader:
1. Taste is valuable
2. By reading this essay you'll be able to improve your taste

Taste means understanding what an audience likes and having the ability to communicate it.
Society treats as if it were a person's innate quality.
That's wrong and discouraging.
But that's also why it's today's hottest commodity in SF tech scene:

<!-- TODO: insert an X post from a well-respected person in SF tech that demonstrates the value of taste -->

In reality, most people don't develop taste for the same reason they don't learn how to draw or speak a second language.
Developing taste requires looking stupid before appearing smart.
Here I'll share my tales of looking stupid.

Think of developing taste as a two step process:

1. \(n = 1\) case: understand what _you_ like.
2. \(n = n + 1\) case: understand what your audience likes.

_\(n\) is the audience size._

## How I found my taste in wine?

When I was 15, I thought I'd be a lot cooler if I would understand wine.
So when my aunt, on her trip to Latvia, offhandedly mentioned "oh, you should totally come to our vineyard", I jumped at it.

That's how I spent my winter holidays installing protective cylinders over tiny pinot gris saplings.
My aunt's vineyard is in Philip Island, which is just off the coast of Melbourne. <!-- TODO fact-check this -->
My cousin has an experimental pop band called The Cool Sounds.
I'd hang out in their band's house in Melbourne whenever I wasn't working at the field.
They'd host house parties with other bands.
For a teenager, these musicians are the coolest people in the world.
Whenever we'd hang out, they would treat me like any other musician in their friend group.
Coming from high-school where I'd barely talk to anyone, that was a monumental shift in my social skills.

I went to around dozen live gigs.
Hung out with the musicians. <!-- TODO: link to the paragraph above -->
Saw around a thousand pieces of art both inside museums and on the streets.
And drank exactly zero glasses of wine.
Because my aunt is a responsible adult.

Now when I came back, everyone expected me to know wine.
Which I did not.
However, I had the newfound confidence to look for good wine and discuss it with people who knew it.
That's how I stumbled into a wine bar with wine-dispenser machines.
If you've never been to one of those, they serve wine by the glass, and keep far more bottles open than a regular bar can.

In this wine bar, I would try multiple glasses of similar wines.
Compare the flavors.
Try to describe them to the somelier.
Get more recommendations.
And repeat.


Have wine.
Compare similar wines.
Change one thing at a time to figure out what you like.

Pay attention
Figure out what's different and what's similar between bottles.
Go from liking a glass of wine to liking how the acidity and texture work together.
It takes time to learn the industry-specific terms.
Not knowing them shouldn't hinder your progress.
Use stupid words to describe specific things.

> The poetry is there for those who are looking for it.

I value taste in people around me because it shows that they pay attention to things most people don't.
They are able to see beauty in things most people don't.

Ask for recommendations.
Now you know something about what you like and what you don't
Find things that have more of what you like.
1. Asking for recommendations forces you to express what you like (and dislike) in concrete terms.
2. Having more of the things you like is the whole point.

## The Wine Merchant

"Creative geniuses" have an exceptional sense for what their target audience likes.
I'll give you an example of one.
<!-- TODO: how to smoothly transition the timeline from past (i.e. When I lived in Warsaw) to present being me living in Warsaw (i.e. the wine merchant asks) -->
While living in Warsaw I come across a small wineshop that's overfilling with clients.
I approach the Italian vintner and ask for a recommendation.

"What's the occasion?"

"It's for a date."

"Is she(?) Polish?"

"Yeah"

"And around your age?"

I answer and ask whether this has anything to do with the choice of wine.
The vintner proceeds to describe the correlations between demographics and wine preferences.
He suggests a couple of options.
There's a semi-sweet that's a safe option and a semi-dry that's more complex but might be a hit or miss.
I take the risk.
We're going to a weird exhibition after all.

On the next day, I'm opening the bottle.
The exhibition was a miss.
I explain to my date how I bought the bottle.
As she tries the wine, she tells me: "I normally only drink sweet wine but this is really good."

The wine merchant is a genius.
Whether he's great at marketing or predicting wine preferences, I don't know to this day.
But he has taste and he knows how to use it to sell[^1].
Taste is closely linked with the ability to sell.
That's why taste is SF tech scene's hottest commodity.

### Taste and Voice

Voice is the ability to create things that pass the taste-test.
Voice is as personal as taste.
A person's ability to appreciate something surpasses their ability to create it.
Taste is the principle that guides voice.
Artist's struggle is in the tension between having the taste of what would be beautiful and not having the voice to express it clearly enough.
Artist's highest pleasure is in seeing their taste and voice meet.
Being your favorite writer for a day is a beautiful feeling.

### Voice and LLMs

LLMs make execution cheap.
That's why taste is increasingly valuable.
LLM's voice is quickly commoditized.
The subjective decisions they make become generic.
They become generic because they are (unconsciously) adopted en masse.
Unsuccessful subjective decisions are cringe to begin with.
Successful LLM decisions sprint through the (original -> standard -> cringe) cycle.

Consider the em dash.
Just two years ago it was a sign of careful writing.
A writer who distinguishes the cases that call for regular dash vs em dash shows that they pay attention.
Taking the time to insert a symbol that's missing on most keyboards demonstrates respect for one's writing.
Em dash communicates to the reader less as punctuation and more as a proxy of writing quality.
This is similar to the M&M test.
<!-- TODO: insert band name --> would prohibit <!-- TODO: color --> M&Ms in their drivers. <!-- TODO: check whether "driver" is the correct term here -->
They did so because their concerts had complex AV setups.
A gig manager who misses a <!-- TODO: color --> M&M from the driver, likely missed the voltage requirements too.

## Remaining questions/room for future thinking

1. Lulu's advice on communicating your own unfiltered sels seems relevant.
    I just can't figure out how.
2. Using LLMs for writing dampens voice.
    Why?
    How does it happen?
3. Why being basic sucks
