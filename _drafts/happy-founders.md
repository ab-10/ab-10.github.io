> Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks.
> He too concludes that all is well.
> This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile.
> Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself, forms a world.
> The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's [or woman's] heart.
> One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

Albert Camus, _The Myth of Sisyphus_
