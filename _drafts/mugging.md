## What's Pascal's Mugging and why do we find it so absurd?

<!-- Pascal's mugging classic edition -->
Mugger: hey, give me all of your money!
You: no, thanks.
Mugger: I just invented a nuclear missile 


1. When we're thinking about Pascal's mugging in ordinary terms we assume that the mugged is able to maintain a mental model, where they believe in the low-probability and extremely low expected value.

The argument of the Mugger consists of two parts:
1. The likelihood of Mugger being honest is larger than zero.
2. The expected value of cooperating with him is nearly infinite.

## Pascal's Mugging in the wild

It's hard to have sympathy for the victim of such Mugging, when we think about it in a factorized version.
However, most people don't hold fractional beliefs.
Or even if they do, they treat them as binary when operating in _system 1_ mode.

So in day-to-day actions, most people, especially the ones who have been victims of Pascal's Mugging, think in terms of products rather than factors.

For example, a startup founder might accept that there's a low probability for a successful exit but the expected value is so high that the total product is higher than her current salary.
But if the startup founder would keep the high failure rate on top of her mind, she would not get anywhere.
She thinks of her actions in terms of the product of the two terms.
Or maybe there's 

She thinks mentally of it as being worth a billion dollars

Instead, we think of the product, as it provides a useful 

The reason why Pascal's mugging feels like such an unbelievable scam is because we assume that 
Instead, I believe the way most cases of Pascal's mugging occur, is t

## Why doesn't balanced EV work?

Why do ideologies need Pascal's Mugging?
Wouldn't a more balanced product work just as well?

No, for two reasons:
1. Balanced EV quickly becomes the norm in the marketplace of ideas.
    Their returns are either assumed to be the baseline.
    Or they are oversubscribed to the point where the expected value is no longer as good as promised.
2. Balanced EV might improve your life but it won't change it.

### Balanced EV quickly becomes the norm

<!-- TODO: find the year when college expected value peaked -->
As a matter of fact, balanced products are so in demand that people frequently will over-index on them for generations after their expected value has dropped.
In year XXXX, getting a university degree had an RoI of $XX.
Even if we discount it by the probability of graduating (XX\%), it's still a good deal.

Compare that with 2023, when US university degree has an RoI of $XX.

Same with corporate jobs.
<!-- TODO: find data on how has job security in large corporations changed throughout 20th century-->
The idea that corporate job comes with high job security is an old adage.
It might've been true in XXXX when the average 

Balanced, high expected value decisions propagate our society and quickly become memes.
