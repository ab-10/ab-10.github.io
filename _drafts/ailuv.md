# Will Artificial Intelligence Make Human intelligence less hot?

How should we value human intelligence once intelligence becomes abundant?

Our society attaches value to intelligence in multiple ways.
It can be monetized directly by getting a high paying job by being smart.
It is virtuous, and being a person who prefers intelligence over other traits is virtuous too.

Value of intelligence manifests in the following contexts:
1. Romantic (i.e. intelligence is sexy)
2. Professional (i.e. smart people tend to have higher paid and more fulfilling careers)
3. Social (i.e. being smart makes you cooler at dinner parties)

In this essay, I'll explore AI's impact on (1.).

<!-- TODO: make it nice and centered -->
The most meaningful romantic conversation you will ever have will be with a language model.
   a) Why is that the case?
   b) What will be the implications of that to human romantic relationships?

## Why will AI partners make better conversationalists than humans?


### The goal

What makes conversations with romantic partners so darn great?


The thing that makes speaking with someone you love so special is the shared background understanding.
You can talk about anything but thanks to the wealth of background experience you've had with each other, the other person just gets you.

There are the big conversations.
Like when you're faced with a tough career decision and your partner reminds you of what you really care about.
Or when he tells you how to get out of an impasse in your family relationship[^2].
The conversations that make you step back and feel that your partner knows you better than you do yourself.

TODO: what does _Her_ have to say about the topic?

Love is many things.
The feeling of being understood.
The ability to discuss deeply personal ideas.
Being listened to during the conversation, and receiving responses that build up in interesting ways.
All of those are important aspects of love.
They are also better suited for language models than humans.


Falling in love with looks is vain and foolish.
Whereas falling in love with the way they speak and listen to you.
Falling in love with the conversations you had or the content of messages you exchanged.
That type of love feels deeper.
It's the type of love that feels more virtuous.
Maybe, it's even the type of love that's more likely to lead to long-term happiness.

### Technical feasibility


Large language models change this in two ways:
1. They create an infinite supply of intelligence.
   Take any manifestation of human verbal intelligence.
   For example, lets take David Foster Wallace's ability to invent complex narrative structures that deliver witty introspection on our society.
   Now a sufficiently good language model should be able to replicate this ability in every way.
   Furthermore, it would have access to more news, classics, or any other resource that DFW would've found useful useful than DFW himself.
   Thus, given the events of today and our what DFW's readers would want to read, an appropriately trained LLM should make the original writings no more relevant than <!-- todo: find a type of art that's only relevant as historic inspiration to what came afterwards --> to even his most fervent fans.
   And now we have software that can generate an infinite amount of _Infinite Jest_.

## What does that mean for our society?

Technology has already simulated one significant component of our romantic lives -- sex.
I think porn is a good case study for some risks created by AI partners, but differs in important ways.

Just like pornography, I believe that AI partners will have broad popularity across our society with various degrees of impact within different subgroups.
There will be some people for whom AI partners are a replacement for romantic relationships all together.
Just like for some unfortunate individuals porn is a replacement for sexual relationships today.
Teenagers are bound to learn a few things from AI partners.
Hopefully, we can create software that makes it safe and actually useful rather than emotionally scarring and manipulative.
But I don't think the usage of AI partners will cause a demographic crisis anywhere.


Where the biggest risk for AI partners lies is in the degree of similarity to the real experience.

**A romantic relationship with an AI partner _is_ a real one.**
After all, you wouldn't argue that a long-distance relationship is not a real one, would you[^1]?
So who cares if your Aussie sweetheart lives in a Queenslander or a GCP Brisbane data center?
Your relationship is identical.


However, your long-distance Aussie sweetheart has flaws.
For one, he might leave you.
But your trusty AI partner would never do that.
Well, as long as you pay the subscription and the AI Brothel Unlimited doesn't go under.

The danger comes from the model being all of the bellow:
   a) Miles better than human conversation partners,
   b) Universally available.
      Software is available to anyone, anywhere, all the time.
      Or available at just the right time to hook you.
      The future AI megacorps can decide that.
   c) Infinitely patient

Scenarios of societal impact:
1. Most people have ruined their human to human conversations.
   Yes, they still have them.
   They still have romantic partners.
   But whenever they talk to a carbon-based being, in the back of their minds, they feel like their AI partner would get them better.
2. Same impact as porn has now.
   It's a guilty pleasure but not a replacement for the real thing.
3. Same impact as Tamagotchis have on pet ownership.
   It's just a fad.

## Will more data give us emotionally superintelligent AI?

Training larger models on more data is bound to produce superintelligence, when we're measuring intelligence on data intensive tasks.
But what is harder to believe is that this superintelligence will be capable understanding social situations, displaying compassion, and warmth.
I disagree.

If anything, I believe a language model that produces emotional solace is easier to create than one producing high-quality physics papers.
This is because in exact sciences the metric is brutally harsh.

Let's take the highest-stakes mathematics challenge in the world, securities pricing.
The average hedge fund performance last year was 5.7\%.
The very fact that you can look this number up is testament to the quantify ability of the task.

Now creating a better AI model for stock pricing is as close to printing money as one can get without breaking the law.
That's why a large fraction of the world's smartest people are spending upwards of hundred hours a week trying to do just that.

Are LLMs likely to disrupt the stock market?
In some sense -- yes.
I can imagine a new wave of hedge funds, composed of brilliant AI researchers, making the current status quo obsolete.
But eventually the performance attained by these hedge funds, along with the incumbents who managed to keep up, will become the norm.
The stock market will continue running its course.
The society will still value the ability of choosing things that will grow in value and selling those things that won't.

Same applies to scientific progress.
When automated data analysis was new, Stephen Wolfram was able to produce a large number of discoveries in physics  early in his career, due the computational tools he created and used.
<!-- TODO: look up A New Kind of Science, to fact check this -->
Now physics departments are on the cutting edge of data analytics and machine learning.
Stephen Wolfram's novel approach, has become absorbed into the status quo.

Unlike stock market predictions or physics discoveries, an influx of emotional intelligence won't increase our society's baseline for it.
This means that if I can get access to someone who meets my threshold of being warm, caring, and attentive to my emotions, I'll perceive that person as such even if I encounter someone who is 2x all of those things.

## Transcript of my notes to Mihai

When we get AI that has verbal intelligence higher than humans and seamless interfaces with humans.
Meaning we can have kind of _Her_ style, companions and so on, but at the same time, those companions would be super intelligent in whatever way we would define intelligence.
How will we perceive intelligence in the form of sexual attraction?
I don't know about you, but one of the main things that I look for in a romantic partner is intelligence and kind of ability to have deep, meaningful conversations.
And if we can get all of that, can be, if not solved, at its core, at least we can create a simulacrum of ten x, the best conversation you're ever going to have with a human being through language modelling.
It's feasible, right?
There's nothing about language models that make it such that you couldn't have the best romantic, intellectual, profound conversation of your life with a language model rather than a romantic partner.
And now, as we're entering that reality, how do we change or value perception of intelligence in romance and intelligence as a virtue of humans?
I don't even know where to begin trying to answer this question.
I just wonder, do you have any thoughts about this?
Have you read anything related?
Or do you think any philosophers would kind of would provide a scratch to this itch?
