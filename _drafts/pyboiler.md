# Quality of Life Boilerplate for Python Projects

Whenever setting up a python project there's a certain amount of boilerplate that just makes the subsequent development experience better.
In this post I'll describe the project structure that tends to work for me.
Although, the structure works sufficiently well for me personally, my goal with this post is more selfish than pedagogical.
The selfish goal being to expose what I'm currently doing to the public and get feedback on how I can improve.
So please do comment and email.

In particular I'd be interested to hear three things:
1. limitations of the outline approaches that I might've not thought of,
2. different/better solutions to the same problems,
3. and other quality of life boilerplate that you're using for your python projects.

# TODO: would this be a good excuse to set up comments
If I do set up comments then write.
As I'd like to explicitly encourage discussion around this topic, I think it would be a good excuse to implement comments on my blog.

Describe my approach to:

1. Setting up poetry
2. Setting up package configs and logging
3. `src/<package-name> directory and the rationale behind that.
