I mainly write in Python, R, Java, English and Latvian. I believe that there's a lot of overlap between writing prose and code, since both demand structured thought from the writer.

I currently work for [Bulkestate](https://bulkestate.com/en/) and study Computer Science in [The University of Manchester](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/).
