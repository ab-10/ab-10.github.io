title: "The Russian Roulette Risk Theory"
---

Main point: any decision can be reduced to a game of Russian roulette, with a sufficient number of chambers.

**The story**

3D printing generative AI startup creates a machine that can create a gun for any probability of death.
Of course the construction process accounts for probability of mechanism failure, external interruption, and epistemological uncertainty.

**Assumptions:**

1. The utilitarian assumption: <!-- TODO: look up good framing for core assumption made by utilitarians -->
2. Any human would trade increase in _quality of life_ for _length of life_ and vice-versa.
    _Quality of life_ here is the quality of conscious experience.
    Giving to charity, learning, and increased confidence that your children will live good lives all account for this.
3. Weighted sum of _quality_ and _length of life_ constitute a universal utility function.

**Games of Russian roulette we play everyday:**

<!-- TODO: find interesting examples of probability of death and construct everyay examples of games of Russian roulette we accept-->

Driving over a speed limit to avoid being late for a meeting expressed as a game of Russian roulette.
