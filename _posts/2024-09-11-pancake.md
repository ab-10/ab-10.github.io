I've noticed a phenomenon in heated discussions where conversation partners become convinced by the other's point of view and flip their positions.
This happens nearly simultaneously.
I call it the Ideological Pancake Flip.
After the Ideological Pancake Flip, the disagreement is still there.
Now, each person is defending their new position.

Importantly, the fact that the other person has been convinced by your previous arguments shouldn't feel like winning.
If it feels like winning, it's not a real Ideological Pancake Flip.
In that case, you are still attached to your old position.

The Ideological Pancake Flip is counterproductive.
Reaching agreement takes longer when a new kind of disagreement has occurred.
It is also beautiful and delicious.
The Pancake Flip is a sign that a further discussion is worthwhile.
It shows that both you and your discussion partner can change minds in light of new information.
It increases empathy because now you know how it feels to hold either of the ideological positions.
It's a sign of respect.
An Ideological Pancake Flip can only occur between intellectual equals.
