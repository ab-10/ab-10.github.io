Dear Life,

You are my something in the sea of nothing.
You are wise beyond measure.
If I could understand a speck of the truths you hold, I'd be the wisest among men.

You are charming beyond words.
For if my words could capture as much as the reflection of your wink, I'd accomplish what nations of poets never could.

You are paradoxical.
You give us those we love the most.
You take away those we love the most, just when we love them the most.

You give us our saddest moments of despair.
You show us the most ecstatic pauses of bliss.
Every moment of happiness I'll ever experience, I'll experience with you.

In the sea of nothing, you are my everything.

I just wanted to make sure you know, that I love you, Life!

Temporarily yours,

A.
