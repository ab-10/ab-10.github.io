Taste means understanding what you like and having the ability to communicate it.

\(n = 1\) case: understand what _you_ like.

\(n = n + 1\) case: understand what your audience likes.

1. Bg describe the discourse on X
2. What do people (on X) mean by taste (optional)
3. How I found my taste in art/books/coffee/wine/food/music/dance performances?
4. LLMs as a killer of voice
5. Taste and voice
    1. Anti-generic
    2. Unique to you
6. Why being basic sucks

## Finding Taste in Food

## How I found my taste in wine?

<!--
Alt structure:
<Numbered list>

<section per item>
<anecdotes from personal experience per section>
-->

Have wine.
Compare similar wines.
Change one thing at a time to figure out what you like.

Pay attention
Figure out what's different and what's similar between bottles.
Go from liking a glass of wine to liking how the acidity and texture work together.
It takes time to learn the industry-specific terms.
Not knowing them shouldn't hinder your progress.
Use stupid words to describe specific things.

> The poetry is there for those who are looking for it.

I value taste in people around me because it shows that they pay attention to things most people don't.
They are able to see beauty in things most people don't.

Ask for recommendations.
Now you know something about what you like and what you don't
Find things that have more of what you like.
1. Asking for recommendations forces you to express what you like (and dislike) in concrete terms.
2. Having more of the things you like is the whole point.



## Finding other people's taste in wine



### Testing Material

> Not another fucking Elf!

-- Hugo Dyson in response to J.R.R. Tolkien's draft of Lord of the Rings.

Understanding target audience is not magical but comes from actively comparing their taste with that of their audience.
For example, Tolkien and C.S. Lewis would organize sessions, where writers would share their drafts and provide honest feedback.

I love testing material.
I created the mailing list for this blog as a way to request feedback on my drafts in an organized way.
Getting feedback on the devtools I build is an important reason why I moved to SF.

### The Wine Merchant

"Creative geniuses" have an exceptional sense for what their target audience likes.
I'll give you an example of one.
<!-- TODO: how to smoothly transition the timeline from past (i.e. When I lived in Warsaw) to present being me living in Warsaw (i.e. the wine merchant asks) -->
While living in Warsaw I come across a small wineshop that's overfilling with clients.
I approach the Italian vintner and ask for a recommendation.

"What's the occasion?"

"It's for a date."

"Is she(?) Polish?"

"Yeah"

"And around your age?"

I answer and ask whether this has anything to do with the choice of wine.
The vintner proceeds to describe the correlations between demographics and wine preferences.
He suggests a couple of options.
There's a semi-sweet that's a safe option and a semi-dry that's more complex but might be a hit or miss.
I take the risk.
We're going to a weird exhibition after all.

On the next day, I'm opening the bottle.
The exhibition was a miss.
I explain to my date how I bought the bottle.
As she tries the wine, she tells me: "I normally only drink sweet wine but this is really good."

The wine merchant is a genius.
Whether he's great at marketing or predicting wine preferences, I don't know to this day.
But he has taste and he knows how to use it to sell[^1].
Taste is closely linked with the ability to sell.
That's why taste is SF tech scene's hottest commodity.

### Taste and Voice

Voice is the ability to create things that pass the taste-test.
Voice is as personal as taste.
A person's ability to appreciate something surpasses their ability to create it.
Taste is the principle that guides voice.
Artist's struggle is in the tension between having the taste of what would be beautiful and not having the voice to express it clearly enough.
Artist's highest pleasure is in seeing their taste and voice meet.
Being your favorite writer for a day is a beautiful feeling.

### Voice and LLMs

LLMs make execution cheap.
That's why taste is increasingly valuable.
LLM's voice is quickly commoditized.
The subjective decisions they make become generic.
They become generic because they are (unconsciously) adopted en masse.
Unsuccessful subjective decisions are cringe to begin with.
Successful LLM decisions sprint through the (original -> standard -> cringe) cycle.

Consider the em dash.
Just two years ago it was a sign of careful writing.
A writer who distinguishes the cases that call for regular dash vs em dash shows that they pay attention.
Taking the time to insert a symbol that's missing on most keyboards demonstrates respect for one's writing.
Em dash communicates to the reader less as punctuation and more as a proxy of writing quality.
This is similar to the M&M test.
<!-- TODO: insert band name --> would prohibit <!-- TODO: color --> M&Ms in their drivers. <!-- TODO: check whether "driver" is the correct term here -->
They did so because their concerts had complex AV setups.
A gig manager who misses a <!-- TODO: color --> M&M from the driver, likely missed the voltage requirements too.

## Remaining questions/room for future thinking

1. Lulu's advice on communicating your own unfiltered sels seems relevant.
    I just can't figure out how.
2. Using LLMs for writing dampens voice.
    Why?
    How does it happen?
