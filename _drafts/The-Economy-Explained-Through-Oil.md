The statment "Oil plays a central role in the global economy" is so obvious it sounds like a truism, however what truly is the nature of this role is far from obvious. For example, _oil wars_ are a common term, yet why would a country fight a war over oil? Is it due to the greed and personal ambitions of the polticans making the decision to enter the war?

The fact that fighting a war over oil has been normalized to an extent where there exists a casual term for it, encapsulates the role played by oil in the global economy better than anything else can. 

I will provide three perspectives to why a country would fight for oil, consequently elucidating the role oil plays in the global economy.

# 1. Military Perspective

The importance of petroleum for military operations creates a viscous cycle, where the military is interested in maintaining a secure oil supply, the security of supply is ensured through military operations (and soft-power influence) that further elevate the requirement for secure oil-supply.

Let's consider the extent to which the hydrocarbons can influence the outcome of wars. 
TODO: mention the role of petroleum in Japanese and German wars.

How did the petroleum establish a paramount role in the military?

Crude oil gained military significance when Naval ships switched from coal to petroleum. When ships used to burn coal, the security of supply was of no concern to the Western powers since most of them have domestic coal supplies. Consequently, Navy's the switch from coal to petroleum provided speed benefits necessary for combat advantage, yet the switch came with a long-term strategy cost.


# 2. Domestic Perspective

# 3. Geopolitical perspective
