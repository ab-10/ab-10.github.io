Taste means understanding what an audience likes and having the ability to communicate it.
Society treats it as if it were a person's innate quality.
That's wrong and discouraging.
But that's also why today it's the hottest commodity in the SF tech scene:

In reality, most people don't develop taste for the same reason they don't learn how to draw or speak a second language.
Developing taste requires looking stupid before appearing smart.
Here I'll share my tales of looking stupid.

## How I found my taste in wine

When I was 15, I thought I'd be a lot cooler if I understood wine.
So when my aunt, on her trip to Latvia, offhandedly mentioned "oh, you should totally come to our vineyard", I jumped at it.

I spent my winter holidays on an island just off the coast of Melbourne installing protective cylinders over tiny pinot gris saplings.
For my aunt, wine and flavor at large is her main craft.
My aunt makes her living from her taste.
During meals, she would pay attention to how people talk about the wine and how much of it they drank.
She was iterating PMF during family dinner.
She trained her taste constantly with experimentation.
One Christmas, she organized a cocktail competition alongside dinner.
The one that won was my cousin's nutty take on eggnog liquor.
That was the first place where I had kangaroo meat and probably the only one.
I've been a vegan for 5 years and still the only thing that would make me go back is that kangaroo steak.

When my uncle offered to have kangaroo steak, I was excited for the novelty but didn't expect much in terms of flavour.
Instead, he barbecued it to a level where it kept the majority of its juice, while being easy to bite through.

> Cousin left a glass of wine at the dinner table and she was like "if you don't like it don't feel like you have to finish it, sorry it's a bit dry."

My cousin has an experimental pop band called The Cool Sounds.
I'd hang out in their band's house in Melbourne whenever I wasn't working in the field.
They'd host house parties with other bands.

They were unpretentious and welcoming.
<!-- TODO maybe cut? -->
Whenever we'd hang out, they would treat me like any other musician in their friend group.
Coming from high-school where I'd barely talk to anyone, that was a monumental shift in my social skills.
<!-- END TODO -->

I found interesting things about me that I did not know myself, such as, for example, that I am a teenager from Europe who's peculiarly interested in wine.
I amplified it, made me discuss it in conversations.
They frequently talked about everyday things with a level of interest and enthusiasm that I would not really consider.
They did not judge other people.
For example, there was a band where one of the bandmates was probably 20 years older than the rest of the band.
They thought of it as the most normal thing in the world because they were shared by their passion for music.
They genuinely liked just playing music and working on their craft without massive amounts of commercial success to back it up.
They didn't really care about commercial success that much, or at least it felt that way.
They really primarily cared about making great music and playing around with it.
They would treat their work as play and share little different things that they've learned along the way.

I went to around a dozen live gigs.
The gigs showed me both the range of what music can be and how people appreciate and love it.
I found it very impressive how, despite it being mainly pop music, every band that I heard, almost every performance, was very unique.
It was a distinct style.
They would experiment with different sounds; it was nothing like the stuff that I would hear on the radio.


<!-- TODO: link to the paragraph above -->
And drank exactly zero glasses of wine.
Because my aunt is a responsible adult.

Now when I came back, everyone expected me to know wine.
Which I did not.
However, I had the newfound confidence to look for good wine and discuss it with people who knew it.
That's how I stumbled into a wine bar with wine-dispenser machines.
If you've never been to one of those, they serve wine by the glass, and keep far more bottles open than a regular bar can.

In this wine bar, I would try multiple glasses of similar wines.
Compare the flavors.
Try to describe them to the sommelier.
Get more recommendations.
And repeat.


Have wine.
Compare similar wines.
Change one thing at a time to figure out what you like.

Pay attention
Figure out what's different and what's similar between bottles.
Go from liking a glass of wine to liking how the acidity and texture work together.
It takes time to learn the industry-specific terms.
Not knowing them shouldn't hinder your progress.
Use stupid words to describe specific things.

> The poetry is there for those who are looking for it.

I value taste in people around me because it shows that they pay attention to things most people don't.
They are able to see beauty in things most people don't.

Ask for recommendations.
Now you know something about what you like and what you don't.
Find things that have more of what you like.
1. Asking for recommendations forces you to express what you like (and dislike) in concrete terms.
2. Having more of the things you like is the whole point.
