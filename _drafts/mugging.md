title: "Every good ideology has a Pascal's Mugging at its core"
---

## What do I want to communicate with the essay?

Belief in an unlikely but transformative future vision is the most powerful motivating force for groups of people to come together and work extremely hard to make it happen.
1. The belief as a unifying force.
2. The belief as a source of motivation for productivity.

1. Every ideology promises its followers either a wonderful outcome or an aversion (?TODO check definition) of a tragic one. 
    1. A core component to this, is the idea of being right in the grand history of time.
2. Even rational people, such as Pascal, can be attracted to this promise.
    They accept it by calculating that the wonderful outcomes even when multiplied by a tiny probability are still worthwhile to pursue.
    1. This is erroneous but the mathematics of the error illustrate the error in the general mental process.
        1. Mathematics: the total probability of _any_ catastrophic event is fixed.
            Victims of Pascal's Mugging tend to focus too much on a single catastrophic event, while ignoring that it's probability must be strictly smaller than the sum of any catastrophic event occuring.
        2. General mental process: the mugging victims don't only shift the focus of the calculus towards the unlikely event, their whole lives become focused on it.
3. Social influence of Pascal's Mugging
    1. Victims of Pascal's Mugging can bond over each other in their unlikely belief.
        Finding other people who share a rare belief is comforting and validating.
        As mugging victims discuss their views, they develop specific language to describe their viewpoints.
    2. This bond also alienates the mugging victims from the general society.
        1. People in general don't accept this belief.
        2. Mugging victims are used to socializing with other people who deeply believe in this viewpoint.
        3. Being used to discussing a belief with others who accept it, creates a contrast when discussing it with the general public.
            This contrast make fully connecting with people outside of your idealogy difficult.
            They don't understand references you're making, regarding niche phenomena in your idealogy.
            You know that open expression to "normies" will be met by scepticism at best and shocked hostility at worst.
            So you don't even try and instead focus on your in-group.
    3. Outside scepticism makes inside criticism difficult.
        Shielding mugging victims from outside scepticism becomes one of the funcions of the in-group.
        Consequently, any mugging victim who criticizes the group risks being seen as an outsider cynic.
        This in turn encourages self-censorship and minimizes group's ability to take on constructive criticism.

## Case studies:

### Salafi Islam

Salafism is a school of Islam that rejects the direction in which Islam has evolved past the three original generations of following Prophet Muhammad.
    <!-- TODO (Lit): get a better (and more relevant definition of Salafi Islam -->
Nearly every organization of Islamic extremism would consider itself to be Salafi.

<!-- TODO (Lit): what are the main Salafi extremist organizations?
                what aspects of Salafism are they using to justify their actions?
                in what sense do they believe that they are right in the grand scheme of time?
                -->

1. Salafism lends itself well to extremism not because it justifies violence, but because the idea of being right in the grand scheme of time is so compelling that it justifies departure from contemporary sociatal norms.
2. Being shunned by contemporaries is a tiny price to pay for being right in the long run.
    Every visionary of the past, from Jesus and Copernicus to J.C.R. Licklider and James Clark were either ostracised seen as weird by their contemporaries.
    Any society is likely to criticise ideas just because they are different.
    As most people tend to be wrong about most new ideas most of the time, people working on radically different ideas must apply a strong filter to the cynicism of others if they want to succeed.
    Unfortunately, it is difficult to distinguish between knee-jerk cynicism of newness and constructive criticism.
    So its easy to dismiss all criticism.
    Consequently, this leaves the person working on the new thing without a sanity check from their contemporaries.

<!-- TODO: what about non-extremist Salafi followers, do they generally show stronger devotion and depth of study than other schools?
    e.g. is complete memorisation of Quran more common within Salafi's than in other schools of Islam.
    -->


### Protestantism
    -> consider how the most extreme followers of Christianity focus on the book of revelations.
### Veganism

I'm neither a Salafi Muslim nor a Protestant, so the analysis of the previous two groups was an observation from the outside rather than the inside.
It is easy to criticise beliefs of others, but my theory would be invalid if I'd consider myself exempt from it.
Now I turn to analysis of two groups that I do consider myself part of: vegans and startup founders.
Both of these groups exemplify minorities who were able to leverage asymmetric societal and economic impact to their size.
I believe that Pascal's Mugging plays a central role in why followers of these groups have managed to collaborate so well and work as hard as they have.

1. Veganism as Pascal's Mugging.
    What does it mean to be right in the grand scheme of time for a vegan?
2. What impact have vegans had?
    1. 
    2. What has been the role of cooperation between vegans in leveraging this impact?

### Startup culture
### Effective altruism
    1. The core idea of effective altruism as Pascal's Mugging.
    2. Effective accelerationsim schism
        1. AI safety people accept that superintelligence poses an existential threat.
        2. In the face of existential threat, any commercial gains that could come from such technology become irrelevant.
        3. Naturally, there emerges an opposing group, who are unconvinced by this type of mugging.
        4. Instead, they believe that AI and in particular machine learning has the power to transform economies and revitalize democracies.
        5. This is a different type of Pascal's Mugging but a Pascal's Mugging nevertheless.
            That is because the current machine learning technology does not offer such capabilities.
            Just like AI Safety people, e/acc's believe that machine learning technology is going to drastically improve.
            However, e/accs believe that humans will be in control of the improved capabilities.
            <!-- TODO: look up what exactly e/accs believe in the techno optimist manifesto-->
        1. What was the event that triggered the schism?
            Was Marc Andressen the one responsible for the split?

## What's Pascal's Mugging and why do we find it so absurd?

Pascal defended the belief in god on probabilistic basis.
If one believes in god and she doesn't exist, nothing's gained and nothing's lost.
And if god does exist, then the eternal life in heaven is nearly infinitely great.
Consequently, Pascal claimed that as long as that there's a non-zero probability of god's existence, the rationalist should believe in her.

Pascal's Mugging is the inversion of this argument by Nick Bostrom.
Nick argues that Pascal's logic exposes him to a simple mugging.
All that the mugger has to is claim that they can provide Pascal with some extremely large reward in the future.
As long as we admit that there is _some_, no matter how small, chance the mugger is telling the truth, it makes sense to hand the money over to him now.
That is, because the small probability multiplied by the huge reward are assumed to be larger than whatever amount Pascal might be carrying in his wallet.

Mugger: Hey, may I have your wallet?

Pascal: No, I'd prefer to keep it myself.

Mugger: What if I told you that I'd bring you a bottle with a genie tomorrow?

Pascal: Then I'd tell you that you're a damn liar!

Mugger: How confident are you that I can't do that?

Pascal: As confident as one can be.
        I'd say nearly 100\%.

Mugger: Nearly?

Pascal: Well, yes.
        Once can never be certain of anything.

Mugger: Would you say that there's at least one in a trillion chance that I could be telling the truth?

Pascal: Hmmm, maybe just about.

Mugger: And you could surely use the Genie to make turn Earth into a space-roaming civilization.
        That would be worth at least a quadrillion dollars!

1. When we're thinking about Pascal's mugging in ordinary terms we assume that the mugged is able to maintain a mental model, where they believe in the low-probability and extremely low expected value.

The argument of the Mugger consists of two parts:
1. The likelihood of Mugger being honest is larger than zero.
2. The expected value of cooperating with him is nearly infinite.

## Pascal's Mugging in the wild

It's hard to have sympathy for the victim of such Mugging, when we think about it in a factorized version.
However, most people don't hold fractional beliefs.
Or even if they do, they treat them as binary when operating in _system 1_ mode.

So in day-to-day actions, most people, especially the ones who have been victims of Pascal's Mugging, think in terms of products rather than factors.

For example, a startup founder might accept that there's a low probability for a successful exit but the expected value is so high that the total product is higher than her current salary.
But if the startup founder would keep the high failure rate on top of her mind, she would not get anywhere.
She thinks of her actions in terms of the product of the two terms.
Or maybe there's 

She thinks mentally of it as being worth a billion dollars

Instead, we think of the product, as it provides a useful 

The reason why Pascal's mugging feels like such an unbelievable scam is because we assume that 
Instead, I believe the way most cases of Pascal's mugging occur, is t

## Ideologies as Pascal's Mugging

Pascal's Mugging is at the core of every good ideology.

1. Low probability of extremely high reward.
2. Working towards it alone provides dopamine.
    The mental image of the success, even without incremental progress, can provide sufficient motivation.
3. This also means that the rewards don't have to be experienced directly, even in the best case scenario.
    Yes, many ideologies promise infinite rewards in the afterlife.
    But one can follow an ideology where they believe that they'll land on the right side of history long after their death.
    In this case, even if the promise materializes, they won't be there to witness its rewards directly.
4. The reward provides a natural bonding mechanism for the community.
    The community by its definition has accepted an unlikely vision of where the world is going.
    People outside of this community will think you as crazy if you speak about it openly.
    Fellow people from the in-group become the only people with whom you can discuss the most interesting vision for the future without being ridiculed.
5. Salafism as Pascal's Mugging.
6. Veganism as Pascal's Mugging.

## Why doesn't balanced EV work?

Why do ideologies need Pascal's Mugging?
Wouldn't a more balanced product work just as well?

No, for two reasons:
1. Balanced EV quickly becomes the norm in the marketplace of ideas.
    Their returns are either assumed to be the baseline.
    Or they are oversubscribed to the point where the expected value is no longer as good as promised.
2. Balanced EV might improve your life but it won't change it.

### Balanced EV quickly becomes the norm

<!-- TODO: find the year when college expected value peaked -->
As a matter of fact, balanced products are so in demand that people frequently will over-index on them for generations after their expected value has dropped.
In year XXXX, getting a university degree had an RoI of $XX.
Even if we discount it by the probability of graduating (XX\%), it's still a good deal.

Compare that with 2023, when US university degree has an RoI of $XX.

Same with corporate jobs.
<!-- TODO: find data on how has job security in large corporations changed throughout 20th century-->
The idea that corporate job comes with high job security is an old adage.
It might've been true in XXXX when the average 

Balanced, high expected value decisions propagate our society and quickly become memes.
Eat your veggies, get some exercise, and donate [malaria nets](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-amf-rob-mather).

### Balanced EV doesn't change lives, it merely improves them
