# What is the role of AI in China-US relations?

In his essay _Why AI Will Save The World_ Marc Andreessen argues that domestic risks of stronger AI are overblown and geopolitical risks of not pursuing stronger AI are underestimated.

> China has a vastly different vision for AI than we do – they view it as a mechanism for authoritarian population control, full stop.
> They are not even being secretive about this, they are very clear about it, and they are already pursuing their agenda.
> And they do not intend to limit their AI strategy to China – they intend to proliferate it all across the world, everywhere they are powering 5G networks, everywhere they are loaning Belt And Road money, everywhere they are providing friendly consumer apps like Tiktok that serve as front ends to their centralized command and control AI.

Are better AI models the bottleneck for CCP's foreign influence? If yes, how would creating better models by the west prevent this threat from actualising?
Emerging threats due to belt and road initiative IMO are a geopolitical policy issue first and technology issue second. Cybersec is a good case study here: https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-12-14/case-cyber-realism

A case against AI geopolitical doomerism:
1. AI is not the bottleneck for CCP's foreign influence.

Counterpoint: if we follow the cybersec analogy then banning any further AI development would be the same as leaving our cybersecurity defence.

What is the bottleneck for CCP's foreign influence?

How is CCP currently exerting foreign influence?

How does China plan to use AI according to its foreign materials?

## What does geopolitical competition between China and the US really mean?

Key areas of geopolitical competition between China and the US:
1. Cybersecurity,
2. Policy regulations regarding technology standards and social media platforms,
3. Traditional and non-traditional forms of espionage.
4. Influence operations in the information space and sub-threshold military activity.

What role does Belt and Road initiative play in China/US geopoltical competition?

What role does New Development Bank play in geopolticical competition?

It exerts China's soft power through development finance.

## The catch-22 of AI policy:

Can the current AI development lead to AGI?

_I'm assuming that AGI poses an existential threat__

**If yes:**

Further development should be halted as to avoid human extinction by AGI.

However, if further development in the field of AI can lead to an existential threat, then it is of core geopolitical importance and thus the western world should win the arms race to AGI.

What does Nick Bostrom say about global colaboration in the context of AGI risk?

**If no:**

AI development is still likely to play an important role in geopolitics but it is unlikely to be the determining factor in global supremacy.

## Would restricting further AI development undermine Western world's ability to compete on the international stage?

Hypothesis: yes, given the broad impact that machine learning has on contemporary society, halting any further development will make Western technology irrelevant in most domains.

1. Machine learning has a broad impact on key areas of geopolitical interest.
2. Current state of ML will soon become uncompetetive in the global stage.
   What are the key metrics that underpin the competetivness of the current systems?
   1. TODO: show a link between core areas of interest and metrics that undeprin these areas.
   2. TODO: aruge that more advanced models are likely to improve these metrics and consequently outcompete existing models in the areas of interest.

## Should western world accelerate AI development to outcompete China on the international stage?

Hypothesis: no, despite playing a role in geopolitics, AI is not the critical factor between success and failure.

This would mean that AI won't play a critical role in any of the main areas of geopolitical competition.

If I still follow the analogy that AI is like cybersecurity: not a replacement for core geopolitical instruments but an important contributing factor regardless.
