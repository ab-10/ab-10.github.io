# If the public doesn't own your work neither do you

Whether you got escorted by security out of the office or got off an awkward Zoom call, at some point you lose access to Github, Gsuite, and the rest of the company accounts.
It feels surprisingly empty.
You worked hard.
You were proud of the work you did.
Yeah, you made some hacks and cut corners in a couple of places.
But the humorous internal docs, beautiful design patterns, and smooth internal tools; those things show who you are as a person as much as your bookshelf does.

Now it's as good as lost in the void.
Especially if it's not accessible to the public and it won't be maintained by anyone internally.
Losing your work like that sucks.

It sucks for the company too.
Frequently, the things one would like to share the most are the least IP sensitive.
Even if we cynically view companies as "evil moneymaking enterprises", the writing is lost press material and the dust-collecting legacy code would at least have a stab at being maintained as an open source project.
But frequently companies are merely "morally neutral moneymaking enterprises".
For many leaders success of employees beyond their work in the company is a source of pride.
This applies to both personal and career interpretations of success.
In that case, making sure the employees can share their work has direct benefit to company's core goals.

So we've arrived at convergence of interests between employees and their corporate overlords:
1. Employees want to own their work because that makes them happy and contributes to their career growth.
2. Companies want the employees (and the public) to own (some of) employee work, as it makes employees happy, gives company free press, and provide free dusting services.

**Solution:** What can be done to mitigate and preserve interests of both parties.

Frequently, people are hesitant to open source rough drafts of their work.
Not because they contain important IP, but just because of how rough they are.

The two reasons for not open sourcing should be distinguished.
If it's the latter, then both employee and employer's incentives are aligned.

In that case the solution is: unlisted open source.

Unlisted open source:
